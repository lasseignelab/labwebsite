Building on my interest in [sharing tools](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108448) with the research community, I am developing project-relevant [R packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ProliferativeIndex/index.html) and Shiny applications including test data and instructional vignettes to facilitate exploration, visualization, and analysis of multidimensional data sets. Such tools will accelerate future discoveries by allowing more rapid analysis of the relationships among genomic data sets and with disease, as well as increase research reproducibility in data-driven approaches to complex disease research.
