A key motivator of my research is applying genomics to complex diseases with the goal of discovering clinically relevant signatures that might be used to improve patient care. In graduate school, I led a project applying next-generation sequencing technologies to kidney cancer tumor and normal tissues to assess [DNA methylation, copy number variation, and microsatellite instability associated with kidney cancer etiology and progression.](https://cdm16608.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/p16608coll23/id/24078/download) This project was a collaboration with Drs. Rick Myers and Devin Absher at HudsonAlpha, and Dr. Jim Brooks at Stanford. One of the most exciting findings in this project was the identification of a panel of high performing [tissue diagnostic biomarkers.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25472429) As a postdoctoral fellow, I provided major analytical contributions to a study with Drs. Guru Sonpavde and Eddy Yang at UAB identifying kinase gene expression associated with kidney cancer metastases compared to kidney tumor or normal tissue, [identifying potential new therapeutic targets.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27574806) My current efforts include designing assays and analytical workflows including machine learning techniques for [determining DNA methylation signatures from cell-free whole genome bisulfite profiles](https://hudsonalpha.org/engage/boeing-pledges-100000-to-hudsonalpha-uab-kidney-cancer-project/) in patient urine and blood and developing non-invasive biomarkers for early identification of cancer, as well as predictive markers of patient response to therapy and monitoring for recurrent disease.
