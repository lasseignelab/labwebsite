<h1>Dry Lab Notebooks</h1>
<p>We generally follow, and encourage others to follow, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385" target="_blank">Ten Simple Rules for a Computational Biologist’s Laboratory Notebook</a>.</p>
<p>Lab notebooks provide a complete record of procedures, reagents, data, and thoughts, as well as an explanation of why/how you are doing an experiment and its results. Our lab uses <a href="https://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> as an online lab notebook with scripts and projects managed in GitHub repositories attached inside.</p>
<p>We recommend taking note of the following in your daily and/or dry lab experiment notebook:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal/purpose of the experiment and/or operations</li>
<li>Systems where the operations were done
<ul>
<li>(e.g. personal laptop or Cheaha)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Directory of operations</li>
<li>Names and locations of scripts and when they were edited or used</li>
<li>Information on and location of raw data</li>
<li>A description of steps like a paragraph for a paper</li>
<li>Any important screenshots, figures, or presentations related to a project</li>
<li>Dates of operations</li>
<li>Versions of programming languages, tools, and/or packages</li>
</ul>

<h1>Git</h1>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a free, open source distributed version control system. It tracks changes, maintains history, and allows you to revert changes. Clones will mirror the full history of the original repository. For more information on this as well as an overview of different version control systems, check out <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control#:~:text=Version%20control%20is%20a%20system,of%20file%20on%20a%20computer" target="_blank">this</a> chapter of the Git documentation book.</p>

<h1>Data Management</h1>
<p><em>This section provides steps you can follow for general data management and storage.</em></p>
<div id="general-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>General Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Back up your data. A general rule to follow is to have three different storage locations.
<ul>
<li>(e.g. on your computer, on Google Drive or a cloud-based location, and on an external hard drive or lab server)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure you have at least one cloud and one off-site storage space for your data and scripts.</li>
<li>Keep data and scripts organized within a directory or workspace. There should be different directories for raw data, scripts, results, and/or documents, but this can vary by project.</li>
<li>Include frequent comments in your code. This is important for keeping it clear for both yourself in the future and for others reviewing it.</li>
<li>When creating a new directory, start with the date (in order to make them sortable by date), then a project title or description.
<ul>
<li>(e.g. 190811_projectname for a project started on 8/11/2019)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When naming files, start with the date, then a title or short description of the script.
<ul>
<li>(e.g. 190811_rna_seq_analysis)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In your scripts, it is important to include:
<ul>
<li>The person who wrote the script</li>
<li>Date(s) of operations of the script</li>
<li>A description of the purpose of the script</li>
<li>Comments about operations done within the script</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create an overview text document in your workspace describing the project, organization of the directory, and locations of data.
<ul>
<li>(e.g. a GitHub README.md)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create and check md5sum files to check if your data files have changed after computational operations (more on that <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/generate-verify-check-files-md5-checksum-linux/" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>
<li>Use a method for version control or note what versions of tools were used for computational operations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="storage-of-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2>Storage of Scripts</h2>
<p>RStudio projects, scripts, and some small files should be stored in a GitHub project/repository as well as a backup location.</p>
</div>
<div id="storage-of-large-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Storage of Large Data</h2>
<div id="cheaha" class="section level3">
<h3>Cheaha</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.uabgrid.uab.edu/wiki/Cheaha" target="_blank">Cheaha</a> is UAB’s cluster computing environment. You can learn more about it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M-OPA9I8S8&list=PLfodFxaCrr0eyWHvZYJr1fdMJlSrECpxt" target="_blank">this</a> youtube video.</p>

<li>This would be used for large data that needs a supercomputer.</li>
<li><strong><em>Cheaha is not a backed up resource.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<div id="tools-for-data-transfer" class="section level4">
<h4>Tools for Data Transfer</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tool “rclone” can be used on Cheaha for copying/moving files to and from cloud storage in Google Drive, Box, and other cloud services. Here are some useful resources:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.uabgrid.uab.edu/wiki/Box.com_bulk_transfer" target="_blank">UAB’s Wiki on transferring between Cheaha and Box with rclone</a>

<div id="data-storage-locations-and-functions" class="section level4">
<h4>Data Storage Locations and Functions</h4>
<ul>
<li>/data/project/lab_name/ (50TB)
<ul>
<li>storage of raw data, genome information files, and storage of results</li>
<li>a lab must send a ticket to Research Computing requesting that project directory be created</li>
</ul></li>
<li>/scratch/username (shared storage - meant for short-term storage during analysis)
<ul>
<li>workspace: copy raw files here to work with, then copy results to the lab project folder or /data/user/username once you are done</li>
</ul></li>
<li>/data/user/username (5-10TB)
<ul>
<li>files for an individual, such as R libraries or individual projects</li>
</ul></li>
<li>/home/username (20-50GB)
<ul>
<li>limited space, but some important files for programs might need to be stored here
(e.g. “.Renviron” for R and RStudio instructions in the cluster)</li>

<div id="external-hard-drives" class="section level3">
<h3>External Hard Drives</h3>
<p>Our lab uses G-Drives, but one needs to be aware of how a given drive is formatted, as this will affect how well it works with different computing platforms. We label these drives with our initials as well as additional labels as needed and a description of what is in the hard drive. Other options are Seagate and other reputable brands with extensive reviews. As external drives are a physical storage device for data, it is important to choose a trustworthy brand and model that is compatible with your needs.</p>
