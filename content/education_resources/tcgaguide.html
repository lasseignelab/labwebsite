<h1>Introduction to TCGA</h1>
<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a resource with omics data for over 20,000 cancer patient tissue profiles spanning 33 cancer types. It is a joint effort between the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute and is publicly available. See the links below for more information:</p>
