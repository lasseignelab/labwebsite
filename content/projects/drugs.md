We develop and apply machine and transfer learning approaches to identify and prioritize genome-driven therapeutic targets and repurposing candidates for patient and cellular phenotypes, including disease and tissue-agnostic or -aware biomarkers. Through collaboration, we test hypotheses generated from these approaches in pre-clinical models (i.e., iPSCs, PDXs, etc.). Additionally, through data science approaches we optimize selection and interpretation of preclinical models for modeling human diseases.
