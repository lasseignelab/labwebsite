We interrogate disease context dependency and the impact of gene regulation, environment, and genetic background on disease manifestations. This includes the role of cell- and tissue-specific gene expression, candidate cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor occupancy, chromatin confirmation and 3D interactions, genomic instabilities, ligand-target pair prediction, and age-associated molecular changes.
