Genomic instability is an important hallmark of cancer and more recently has been identified in others like neurodegenrative diseases. Chromosomal instability, as a measure of genomic instability, has been used to characterize clinical and biological phenotypes associated with these diseases by measuring structural and numerical chromosomal alterations. There have been multiple chromosomal instability scores developed across many studies in the literature; however, these scores have not been compared because of the lack of a single tool available to calculate and facilitate these various metrics. Here, we provide an R package CINmetrics, that calculates six different chromosomal instability scores and allows direct comparison between them. We also demonstrate how these scores differ by applying CINmetrics to breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The package is available on CRAN at https://cran.rproject.org/package=CINmetrics and on GitHub at https://github.com/lasseignelab/CINmetrics.
