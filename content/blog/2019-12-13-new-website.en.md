**Welcome to the new Lasseigne Lab website!** We have been working hard to get it up and running with the hopes that we can share whatâ€™s going on in the lab.

  We've been lucky to have built up a strong team within the lab. This summer we welcomed Sasha Thalluri and Avery Williams, two undergraduate research assistants majoring in genetics and enthusiastic to learn more about working in a lab. We were then fortunate to have Randi Wood join as lab manager, and she has been working hard to bring the wet side of our lab into motion.
  
  We then had three graduate students, Jordan Whitlock, Jen Fisher, and Tabea Soelter, rotate through our lab. They each took on their own project that contributed to the research of the lab. Their projects were mainly computational in focus, and they contributed to library preparation as part of their wetlab training. Jordan and Jen then made the decision to join the lab and we are excited about what they will accomplish with us.
  
  Vishal Oza is our new computational-focused staff scientist, and we are also happy to have Drew Hardigan on the team as he completes a short postdoc for his MD/PhD. Our lab seems to be growing more and more by the day and we look forward to what more our team will become and accomplish.
