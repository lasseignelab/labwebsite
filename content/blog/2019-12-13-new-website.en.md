Welcome to the new Lasseigne Lab website! We have been working hard to get it up and running with the hopes that we can share what’s going on in the lab. We’ve been lucky to have built up a great team of staff scientists, rotation grad students, and undergrads. This first post will include some information about our team and what they’ve been working on!
