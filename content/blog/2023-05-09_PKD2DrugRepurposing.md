Background. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most prevalent monogenic human diseases. It is mostly caused by pathogenic variants in PKD1 or PKD2 genes that encode interacting transmembrane proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2). Among many pathogenic processes described in ADPKD, those associated with cAMP signaling, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming appear to regulate the disease manifestations. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor-2 antagonist that regulates cAMP pathway, is the only FDA-approved ADPKD therapeutic. Tolvaptan reduces renal cyst growth and kidney function loss, but it is not tolerated by many patients and is associated with idiosyncratic liver toxicity. Therefore, additional therapeutic options for ADPKD treatment are needed.

Methods. As drug repurposing of FDA-approved drug candidates can significantly decrease the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery, we used the computational approach signature reversion to detect inversely related drug response gene expression signatures from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database and identified compounds predicted to reverse disease-associated transcriptomic signatures in three publicly available Pkd2 kidney transcriptomic data sets of mouse ADPKD models. We focused on a pre-cystic model for signature reversion, as it was less impacted by confounding secondary disease mechanisms in ADPKD, and then compared the resulting candidatesâ€™ target differential expression in the two cystic mouse models. We further prioritized these drug candidates based on their known mechanism of action, FDA status, targets, and by functional enrichment analysis.

Results. With this in-silico approach, we prioritized 29 unique drug targets differentially expressed in Pkd2 ADPKD cystic models and 16 prioritized drug repurposing candidates that target them, including bromocriptine and mirtazapine, which can be further tested in-vitro and in-vivo.

Conclusion. Collectively, these results indicate drug targets and repurposing candidates that may effectively treat pre-cystic as well as cystic ADPKD.
