      <description>It has been an eventful eight months. Our first and most recent entry was posted in March of this year, and much has happened since then! While COVID-19 has had a tragic negative effect on the world around us, we have been very fortunate to have had plenty of positive events as well.
Since our last update, Drew has moved on to a neurosurgery residency at Duke University. Randi has also moved on to opportunities elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the new Lasseigne Lab website! While still under construction, we wanted to share a first post about our new team!

We&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to recruit such a strong, interdisciplinary team. This past summer we welcomed Sasha Thalluri and Avery Williams, two undergraduate genetics research assistants enthusiastic to learn more about science and the lab environment. Shortly after, Randi Wood joined as a staff scientist and our lab manager.</description>

      <description>Our research focuses on developing approaches for assaying and integrating omics data, functional annotations, and patient information to discover novel mechanisms in disease etiology and progression, therapeutic targets, and circulating biomarkers.
 Current Members Brittany Lasseigne, Ph.D. Principal Investigator and Assistant Professor Dr. Lasseigne is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, an Associate Scientist in both the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center Experimental Therapeutics Program and the Center for Clinical and Translational Science, and a Scientist in both the Informatics Institute and the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</description>

      <title>BioTrain Computational Biology Workshop 2018</title>
      <link>/2018-06-04-biotraincompbioworkshop2018/</link>

      <guid>/2018-06-04-biotraincompbioworkshop2018/</guid>
      <description>Objective/Rationale: This one day workshop is intended to provide HudsonAlpha undergraduate student BioTrain interns and graduate rotation students an introduction to computational biology through a discussion on why computers are necessary in genomics, short unix shell and R tutorials followed by hands-on exercises (The Carpentries lessons), and tips on how to ask for help, keeping a computational lab notebook, and finding additional learning resources. Pre-requisites: Curiosity about computational biology and a basic understanding of the concepts of files and directories.</description>

      <title>Context of Disease Manifestations</title>
      <link>/projects/context/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/projects/context/</guid>
      <description>We interrogate disease context dependency and the impact of gene regulation, environment, and genetic background on disease manifestations. This includes the role of cell- and tissue-specific gene expression, candidate cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor occupancy, chromatin confirmation and 3D interactions, genomic instabilities, ligand-target pair prediction, and age-associated molecular changes.</description>

      <guid>/projects/drugs/</guid>
      <description>We develop and apply machine and transfer learning approaches to identify and prioritize genome-driven therapeutic targets and repurposing candidates for patient and cellular phenotypes, including disease and tissue-agnostic or -aware biomarkers. Through collaboration, we test hypotheses generated from these approaches in pre-clinical models (i.e., iPSCs, PDXs, etc.). Additionally, through data science approaches we optimize selection and interpretation of preclinical models for modeling human diseases.</description>

      <title>Multiomics Assay and Analytical Approaches</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/projects/multiomics/</guid>
      <description>We develop and apply ‘wet’ molecular biology and ‘dry’ computational approaches with the goal of extracting the most information possible from the smallest sample input at the lowest cost and then turn that information into actionable knowledge. To achieve this, we implement multiplexed sequencing approaches to assay circulating DNA and RNA from biofluid samples (i.e., ‘liquid biopsies’), as well as statistical methods (including network approaches) for integrating omics data, functional annotations, and patient information to improve disease state prediction, particularly for small (including n=1) and heterogeneous cohorts.</description>
