      <description>Ten simple rules for using public biological data for your research
Journal: PLoS Computational Biology
Authors: Vishal H. Oza, Jordan H. Whitlock, Elizabeth J. Wilk, Angelina Uno-Antonison, Brandon Wilk, Manavalan Gajapathy, Timothy C. Howton, Austyn Trull, Lara Ianov, Elizabeth A. Worthey, and Brittany N. Lasseigne
With an increasing amount of biological data available publicly, there is a need for a guide on how to successfully download and use this data. The 10 simple rules for using public biological data are: (1) use public data purposefully in your research; (2) evaluate data for your use case; (3) check data reuse requirements and embargoes; (4) be aware of ethics for data reuse; (5) plan for data storage and compute requirements; (6) know what you are downloading; (7) download programmatically and verify integrity; (8) properly cite data; (9) make reprocessed data and models Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) and share; and (10) make pipelines and code FAIR and share.</description>

      <description>CINmetrics: An R package for chromosomal instability analysis
Authors: Vishal H. Orza, Jennifer L. Fisher, Roshan Darjoi, Brittany N. Lasseigne
Genomic instability is an important hallmark of cancer and more recently has been identified in others like neurodegenrative diseases. Chromosomal instability, as a measure of genomic instability, has been used to characterize clinical and biological phenotypes associated with these diseases by measuring structural and numerical chromosomal alterations. There have been multiple chromosomal instability scores developed across many studies in the literature; however, these scores have not been compared because of the lack of a single tool available to calculate and facilitate these various metrics.</description>

      <description>Liquid biopsies in epilepsy: biomarkers for etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics
Journal: Human Cell
Authors: Jordan H. Whitlock, Tabea M. Soelter, Avery S. Williams, Andrew A. Hardigan, and Brittany N. Lasseigne
Epilepsy is one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system, impacting nearly 50 million people around the world. Heterogeneous in nature, epilepsy presents in children and adults alike. Currently, surgery is one treatment approach that can completely cure epilepsy.</description>

      <description>We are back with another update! Thank you for taking the time to check in on how our lab is evolving and growing! It has been almost two years since our last update, so a lot has happened!
To begin, here&amp;rsquo;s a little &amp;ldquo;lab space update&amp;rdquo; on how we&amp;rsquo;ve made ourselves at home in our dry lab space: We are so thankful for this space to hold our ever-growing lab! Next, we&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you to our newer members and summer students that we have had since the last update:</description>

      <title>First Update</title>
      <link>https://lasseigne.org/blog/first-update/</link>

      <guid>https://lasseigne.org/blog/first-update/</guid>
      <description>It has been an eventful eight months. Our first and most recent entry was posted in March of this year, and much has happened since then! While COVID-19 has had a tragic negative effect on the world around us, we have been very fortunate to have had plenty of positive events as well.
Since our last update, Drew has moved on to a neurosurgery residency at Duke University. Randi has also moved on to opportunities elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the new Lasseigne Lab website! While still under construction, we wanted to share a first post about our new team!
**(left to right) Tabea Soelter, Jen Fisher, and Jordan Whitlock** We&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to recruit such a strong, interdisciplinary team. This past summer we welcomed Sasha Thalluri and Avery Williams, two undergraduate genetics research assistants enthusiastic to learn more about science and the lab environment. Shortly after, Randi Wood joined as a staff scientist and our lab manager.</description>

      <title>Context of Disease Manifestations</title>
      <link>https://lasseigne.org/projects/context/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lasseigne.org/projects/context/</guid>
      <description>We interrogate disease context dependency and the impact of gene regulation, environment, and genetic background on disease manifestations. This includes the role of cell- and tissue-specific gene expression, candidate cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor occupancy, chromatin confirmation and 3D interactions, genomic instabilities, ligand-target pair prediction, and age-associated molecular changes.</description>

      <title>Drug Target and Repurposing Prioritization</title>

      <guid>https://lasseigne.org/projects/drugs/</guid>
      <description>We develop and apply machine and transfer learning approaches to identify and prioritize genome-driven therapeutic targets and repurposing candidates for patient and cellular phenotypes, including disease and tissue-agnostic or -aware biomarkers. Through collaboration, we test hypotheses generated from these approaches in pre-clinical models (i.e., iPSCs, PDXs, etc.). Additionally, through data science approaches we optimize selection and interpretation of preclinical models for modeling human diseases.</description>

      <title>Multiomics Assay and Analytical Approaches</title>

      <guid>https://lasseigne.org/projects/multiomics/</guid>
      <description>We develop and apply ‘wet’ molecular biology and ‘dry’ computational approaches with the goal of extracting the most information possible from the smallest sample input at the lowest cost and then turn that information into actionable knowledge. To achieve this, we implement multiplexed sequencing approaches to assay circulating DNA and RNA from biofluid samples (i.e., ‘liquid biopsies’), as well as statistical methods (including network approaches) for integrating omics data, functional annotations, and patient information to improve disease state prediction, particularly for small (including n=1) and heterogeneous cohorts.</description>

      <description>The Lasseigne Lab uses genomic strategies and data to study complex and rare diseases with the goal of discovering biological signatures that might be used to improve patient care and provide insight into molecular processes contributing to disease. We currently have active collaborations in cancer, neurodegeneration, kidney, and rare disease projects.
