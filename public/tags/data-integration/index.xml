      <description>As a postdoctoral fellow, Brittany lead and/or participated in several projects aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind broad molecular changes (e.g., thousands of differentially expressed genes between normal and disease tissues). For example, she and her colleagues identified transcription factor binding sites with altered DNAm in prostate cancer and genomic regulation of triple negative breast cancer invasion. Likewise, by measuring relative cell proliferation from gene expression data across 19 cancers, they demonstrated cell proliferation is a major driver of gene expression variation, is strongly associated with clinical characteristics, and by stratifying on cell proliferation, improved predictive models of patient survival.</description>
